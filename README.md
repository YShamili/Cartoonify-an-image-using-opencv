## What it does:  
*Loads an image file.  
*Applies the techniques such as Grayscale, Bilateral filter, Edge detection and finally cartoonify an image.  
*As we combine the gray scale filter, bilateral filter, edge detection then we get the cartoon version of the image.

## Used:  
*Python  
*OpenCV  
*Matplotlib  
*Jupyter Notebook

### Learning note:  
I am new to OpenCV and I have learned some basics of the OpenCV and matplotlib with the help of ChatGPT. I built this project to explore how image processing works and to have fun. I have taken the help of ChatGPT.
